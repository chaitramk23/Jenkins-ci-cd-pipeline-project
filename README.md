# Jenkins-ci-cd-pipeline-project
Jenkins ci/cd pipeline project using argocd gitops tool for deploy the application
this project expalin a CI/CD pipeline with a focus on Argo CD, which is a key tool used at the end to deploy the app.

# Step-by-Step Process:
# Code Update:
-A developer updates the app's code in a code repository (e.g., GitHub). When the code is pushed, a signal (called a webhook) is sent to start the pipeline.

# Jenkins Pipeline:
-Maven Build: Jenkins, a tool for automating tasks, first uses Maven to build (or compile) the code. If the code has issues, the process stops here.
-Code Quality Check with SonarQube: Next, SonarQube checks the code for errors or security problems.
-Testing: Jenkins then runs automated tests to make sure everything works as expected. If tests fail, it stops the process, and a report is sent to the team. If it 
 passes, the pipeline continues.

# Docker Image Creation:
-After the code passes all checks, Jenkins packages it into a Docker image (a snapshot of the app with everything it needs to run) and uploads this image to 
 DockerHub.

# Image Updater:
A tool called an Image Updater detects that a new image has been uploaded. It then updates a special Git repository (called the Manifests Repo) with this new version of the app. This repository holds instructions for how the app should be set up in the Kubernetes environment (where it will run).

# Argo CD’s Role in Deployment:
-Here’s where Argo CD comes in! Argo CD is a tool that watches the Manifests Repo for any changes. When it sees the new version in the repo, it automatically 
 deploys the updated version of the app to the Kubernetes environment.
-Argo CD makes sure that what’s running in Kubernetes always matches what’s in Git. This means the team doesn’t have to do anything manually to update the app in 
 the live environment — Argo CD takes care of it.
-By continuously checking the repo, Argo CD helps keep the app in sync with the latest version, making it easy to track and control what’s live.
 
# Notifications:
 -Throughout this process, the pipeline sends notifications (e.g., on Slack or via email) to keep everyone informed about what’s happening, especially if there are 
  any issues.
 -Why Argo CD is Important:
  Argo CD simplifies deployment because it automatically pushes the latest version to Kubernetes whenever there’s a new update. This hands-off approach (called 
  GitOps) means the team only needs to update Git, and Argo CD will handle the rest, ensuring that the live environment is always current.
 -This automation saves time, reduces the chance of human errors, and makes it easy to track changes.
 -In summary, this pipeline automates the steps from writing code to deploying the app live, with Argo CD playing a crucial role in making sure deployments happen 
  smoothly and without manual steps.
